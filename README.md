# Full-Stack App Template

A reusable full-stack template for AI-assisted development with Docker, FastAPI, React, Poetry, and Vite.

## Tech Stack

| Layer    | Technology                          |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Backend  | Python 3.12+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2 |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Database | SQLite (async via aiosqlite)        |
| State    | TanStack React Query 5             |
| Routing  | React Router 7                      |
| Tooling  | Docker Compose, Poetry, npm        |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the Docker image
make build

# Start the app (backend on :8000, frontend on :5173)
make server

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# View logs
make logs

# Run tests
make test

# Stop
make clean
```

## Architecture Overview

**Backend** follows a three-layer architecture:
- **Router** (`api/v1/`) — HTTP endpoints, input validation
- **Service** (`services/`) — business logic, database queries
- **Model** (`models/`) — SQLAlchemy ORM definitions

**Frontend** separates concerns:
- **Pages** — route-level components
- **Services** — API calls via `apiFetch` + React Query hooks
- **Types** — TypeScript interfaces mirroring backend schemas

## Adding a New Feature

### Backend
1. Create ORM model in `app/models/`
2. Create Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/` (Create, Update, Response)
3. Create async service functions in `app/services/`
4. Create router with endpoints in `app/api/v1/`
5. Register router in `main.py`
6. Add tests in `tests/`

### Frontend
1. Add TypeScript types in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Create API service + React Query hooks in `src/services/`
3. Create page component in `src/pages/`
4. Add route in `src/App.tsx`

## Environment Variables

| Variable         | Default                             | Description       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `APP_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./app.db`    | Database URL      |
| `VITE_API_URL`   | `http://localhost:8000`             | Backend API URL   |

## AI-Assisted Development

This template includes GitHub Copilot coding agent configuration files under `.github/`:

- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** — repo-wide instructions (tech stack, commands, architecture overview, adding a new feature)
- **`.github/instructions/backend.instructions.md`** — backend-specific rules and conventions (scoped to `backend/**`)
- **`.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md`** — frontend-specific rules and conventions (scoped to `frontend/**`)
- **`.github/copilot-setup-steps.yml`** — environment setup for the Copilot coding agent VM
## AI-Coding Tutorial

1. Refine requirements with this prompt:
```
You're a senior software engineer. We're going to build the PRD of a feature
together.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- Ask one question at a time
- Each question should be based on previous answers
- Go deeper on every important detail required

IDEA:
<paste here your task description>

2. When you are done dump summary in specs.md file:
```
Compile those findings into a PRD. Use markdown format. It should contain the
following sections:

- Feature overview
- Core requirements
- Core features
- Core components
- App/user flow
- Techstack
- Implementation plan
```

3. Create an Implementation plan.md with:
```
Based on the generated PRD, create a detailed step-by-step plan to build this feature.
Then break it down into small tasks that build on each other.
Based on those tasks, break them into smaller subtasks.
Make sure the steps are small enough to be implemented in a step but big enough
to finish the project with success.
Use best practices of software development and project management, no big
complexity jumps. Wire tasks into others, creating a dependency list. There
should be no orphan tasks.

VERY IMPORTANT:
- Use markdown or asciidoc 
- Each task and subtask should be a checklist item
- Provide context enough per task so a developer should be able to implement it
- Each task should have a number id
- Each task should list dependent task ids
```

4. Finally implement the plan with:
```
You're a senior software engineer. Study @docs/specs.md and implement what's
still missing in @docs/plan.md. Implement each task each time and respect task
and subtask dependencies. Once finished a task, check it in the list and move
to the next.
```
